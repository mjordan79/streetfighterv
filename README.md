### 1. Floe Technique for frametrap.
**Training Room Settings:**\
Stand, Guard after first attack, No Recovery or Normal Recovery, Counter Normal, No Stun.\
**Technique (No Recovery):**\
c.mp, st.mp, Tenko, Mujinkiaku. While the opponent is falling --> c.mp, VSkill 1.\
The opponent is forced to parry. After the parry --> c.lp, st.mp, Tenko, Mujinkiaku.\
Repeat the strategy for massive pressure.\
**Technique (Normal Recovery):**\
Like before, but if the opponent has not woken up already, after the VSkill 1, continue the pressure with c.lp, VSkill 1.

### 2. Floe Technique for Crossup Situation.
**Technique (Normal Recovery):**\
c.mp, st.mp, JF Tenko, Mujinkiaku. While the opponent is on the ground, small forward step and jump-in for a crossup.\
**Technique (No Recovery):**\
If the opponent hasn't woken up already, after the jump-in do a backdash and re-jump-in towards the opponent for a crossup situation.

### 3. Floe Technique for Meaty Cross-Under. **[DEPRECATED]**
**Technique (Stay in front with lk dash, cross-under with mk dash):**\
c.mp, st.mp, EX-shoulders. When the opponent falls, st.mp, lk dash (remains in frontof the opponent).\
Substitute lk dash with mk dask to cross-under.

### 4. Shindoru Technique for escaping combo into meaty setup.
Useful for getting out of the corner and reverse the situation.\
**Training Room Settings:**\
Normal or Quick Recovery with jab on recovery.\
**Technique (Normal Recovery):**\
st.hp, JF Tenko, Mujinkiaku, EX Tenko. While the opponent is in air, forward dash with hk Seppo to cross under.\
At this point, you're in the opposite side right in front of the opponent. Re-forward dash with Seppo while he's recovering\
and go with a c.mp (meaty) continuing with a combo.\
**Technique (No Recovery):**\
If no recover is made, do the same thing: forward dash with seppo and c.mp. The opponent has not woken up already,\ 
so redo a forward dash and do st.lk, c.mp and continue the combo.\
